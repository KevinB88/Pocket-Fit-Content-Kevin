How we will organize the repo/work produced by the engineers:

(Kevin) (Giancarlo) (Abid) (Zinnah)

Backend:
  Stack: Python; tensorflow, OpenCV, HTML, CSS 

Frontend:
  TBH

Additional Research:
1) Tensorflow/OpenCV; reccomendation algorithms, QR-code/public link generation, detecting articles of clothing. 
2) Fashion Design/related principles


Initial Steps/Things to consider:
1) Brainstorm template/rundown to determine the tech stack
2) Determine everyone's responsbility on individual branches
3) To mitigate branch conflicts employ modular-code practices
4) Have one or two engineers work on the machine learning/backend/(focus on already trained models instead of pre-training/implementing our own from scratch)
5) Have another engineer work with the frontend, think of design features on the application
6) After allocating tasks to engineers, keep track of which tasks have been completed. (Utilize Lucid-charts to keep track)
